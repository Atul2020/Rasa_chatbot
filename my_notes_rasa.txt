MY NOTES:
[24-11-2020]
	Rasa is an open source machine learning framework for building AI assistants and chatbots. 

	It has 2 main modules:
	-Rasa NLU for understanding user messages
	-Rasa Core for holding conversations and deciding what to do next.

	Installing:
		-To install rasa in command line use:
		 pip install rasa
		-To install in pycharm go to interpreter settings and download from there

	-Using the command "rasa init" will create a sample moodbot where we can chat with the bot.

	-After making changes to the files use "rasa train" to train the bot on the data added.
	-Use the "rasa shell" command to interact with the trained model.


	CheatSheet for Terminal Commands ##

	Command			Effect
	rasa init	        Creates a new project with example training data, actions, and config files.
	rasa train	        Trains a model using your NLU data and stories, saves trained model in ./models.
	rasa interactive        Starts an interactive learning session to create new training data by chatting to your assistant.
	rasa shell	        Loads your trained model and lets you talk to your assistant on the command line.
	rasa run	        Starts a server with your trained model.
	rasa run actions        Starts an action server using the Rasa SDK.

	rasa test	        Tests a trained Rasa model on any files starting with test_.
	rasa data split nlu	Performs a 80/20 split of your NLU training data.
	rasa data convert	Converts training data between different formats.
	rasa data validate	Checks the domain, NLU and conversation data for inconsistencies.
	rasa export	        Exports conversations from a tracker store to an event broker.
	rasa x			Launches Rasa X in local mode.
	rasa -h			Shows all available commands.

	***When running in pycharm use "python -m command"***

	-Added more examples in training data.
	
	-Created a Rasa form to get input from the user when the chatbot asks a series of questions.
	
	-Rasa forms use slots to get the data from the user.
	
	-Created an actions.py file that creates a FormAction.
	
	-Created slot mappings that tells Rasa how to extract slot values from the user.
	
 	The  action server and Rasa server have to be run seperately.

	# Learned about creating nlu training data.
	
	 -NLU training data stores structured information about user messages.
	 
	 -The nlu.md file contains various intents with the a set of training examples for each intent.
	 
	 -The more the number of training examples provided the better the chatbot will be able to perform.
	 
	 -Entitites can be represented in the training data within brackets so that the specific information can be extracted from the user information.
	 
	# Learned about the pre-configured pipelines present in rasa.	
	
	 -There are 2 pre-configured pipelines present in Rasa:
	    	 	
	    	 1)pretrained_embeddings_spacy pipeline
	    	   
	    	   -It loads the pretrained language models
	    	   
	    	   Advantages:
	    	   	-Better model performance with less training data required
	    	   	- Faster training and iteration times
	    	   Disadvantages:
	    	   	-We are limited to languages which have pretrained word embeddings
	    	   	-They do not cover domain specific words such as product names.
	    	 
	    	 2) supervised_embeddings pipeline
	    	   
	    	    - This pipeline is used to learn everything from scratch based on the data provided in the nlu.yml file.
	    	    
	    	    Advantages:
	    	    	- The model will pick up domain specific vocabulary.
	    	    	
	    	    	- You can build assistants in any language that can be tokenized.
	    	    	
	    	    	- It can be used to habdle advanced cases such as messages with multiple intents.

	# Learned about the pipeline components present.
	 
	#Learned about the dialogue management 
	 
	 - The dialogue management is done in the stories.yml file.
	 
	 -The stories.yml file contains various stories or paths.
	 
	 - Each path contains steps which consists of actions for each intent.
	 
	# Learned about domains,custom actions and slots.
		
	  Domain:
	  	
	  	-The domain is specified in the domain.yml file.
	  	
	  	-The names of the intents and entities are declared in this file.
	  	
	  	-All the responses for the actions present in the stories.yml file are declared here.
	  
	  Custom actions:
	  	
	  	- Custom actions are declared in the actions.py file.
	  	
	  	-They are the responses of an assistant that include a custom code.
	  	
	  	-Any code can be run here like api calls and database queries.
	  	
	  Slots:
	  	
	  	-Slots are used to get and store the information as a form.
	  	
	  	-Slots are the bot's memory.
	  	
	  	-Types of slots are:
	  		
	  		-Text slot
	  		-Boolean slot
	  		-Categorical slot
	  		-Float slot
	  		-List slot
	  		-Unfeaturized slot
	 
	
	# Started learning about dialogue policies.

	#Rasa Action Server:
	
	 -The Rasa Action Server runs custom actions for Rasa Open source conversational assistant.
	 
	 - Rasa run actions command is used to run the actions server from the actions.py file.
	
	
	 A custom action looks like this:
	 	
	 "class MyCustomAction(Action):

    		def name(self) -> Text:

        		return "action_name"

    	async def run(
        	self, dispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: Dict[Text, Any],
  	) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:

        return [] "
        
        
        -To define a custom action, a subclass of action class is created and the two methods run and action have to be overwritten.
        
        -The tracker class represents the Rasa conversation tracker.
        
        -The Dispatcher is used to generate responses to send ack to the user
	                                     
	                                     
	#RasaX:
	 
	 -RasaX is a toolset used to improve assistants built with rasa open source.
	 
	 -It allows us to easily share our assistant with real users and review their conversations to improve the chatbot.
	 
	 -Learned how rasa x can be installed in the local mode and how it is run.
	 
	 -To install Rasa X on the local machine use:
	 
	     pip3 install rasa-x --extra-index-url https://pypi.rasa.com/simple
	    
	 -Then use "rasa X" command to launch the interactive UI.
	 
	 
	 #Learned about how our chatbot can be shared with everyone for development using ngrok.
	 
	   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSF7mIPW8qE&list=PLtFHvora00y8NBwCMoNnPqii-y2-gyl5p&index=13
	 
	  -Login to ngrok and connect your account by running the authtoken command.
	  
	  -Run ./ngrok http 5002 command to set your tunnel up and running.
	  
	  -Then use the url provided by ngrok and replace it with the localhost part of the shared url from Rasa X.
	  
	  -This url can be shared with anyone and their conversations will be recorded by Rasa x and the conversations can be used for development purpose.
