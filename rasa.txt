MY NOTES:

Rasa is an open source machine learning framework for building AI assistants and chatbots. 

It has 2 main modules:
-Rasa NLU for understanding user messages
-Rasa Core for holding conversations and deciding what to do next.

Installing:
	-To install rasa in command line use:
	  pip install rasa
	-To install in pycharm go to interpreter settings and download from there

-Using the command "rasa init" will create a sample moodbot where we can chat with the bot.

-After making changes to the files use "rasa train" to train the bot on the data added.

-Use the "rasa shell" command to interact with the trained model.
